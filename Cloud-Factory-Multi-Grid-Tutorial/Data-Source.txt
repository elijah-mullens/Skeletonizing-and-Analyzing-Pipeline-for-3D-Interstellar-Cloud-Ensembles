Have to use the Binary-To-Fits folder to turn AREPO files into fits files (Make sure you run both notebooks, Making-HI-Files second)

Star-Forming-Sink-Files contain npy files with all the star forming sinks (see Cloud-Factory-Pipeline-Output-Analysis)

Cloud-Factory-Multi-Grid-Pipeline is a clean directory where the pipeline has not been run, the ran version is where the pipeline as been run. The output analysis folder contains a notebook that explores the pipeline outputs one-by-one.
