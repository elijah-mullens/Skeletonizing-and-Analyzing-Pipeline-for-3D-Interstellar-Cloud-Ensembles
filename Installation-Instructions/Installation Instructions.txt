Installation Instructions 

I reccomend creating a new conda environment for filfinder3d

You will need to download the filfinder3d. 
Once FilFinder is downloaded, open the terminal, type “cd /path/to/directory/”  to go to the FilFinder directory
and then “pip install -e .” Make sure you have python 3.9.

As for the rest of the packages, go to Installation-Test.ipynb and just make sure you can run
the installation cell 

If not, conda install or pip install the necessary packages.
